Detect robust functional/marker gene modules
Cell-type / condition specific markers
Metagenes ïƒ  modular embedding (space)
Like popAlign
Capture perturbed gene dependency structures
Which associations are perturbed in response to disease/treatment
Detect cell-type specific gene regulatory programs 
(de-)Active pathways during cell differentiation
Simulating single cell data
More accurate simulations (SERGIO like)
Possible to inject batch-effects (if robust!)
Gene regulatory network inference
Maybe by injecting RNA velocity?
